The datasets are provided from Kaggle:

Flower Classification | 10 Classes: it containts 3 folders, training, validation and testing respectively; each folder contains 10 folders with types of flowers, 1500 images for each flower for training and 500 for validation, for testing the dataset does not provide a costant number of images of each flower.

Birds 500 Species- Image Classification: it contains 3 folders, training, validation and testing respectively; each folder contains 500 folders with types of birds, the dataset does not provide a constant number of images for each type of bird; It also contain a .csv file with: "id", "filepaths", "labels", "data set" and "scientific name". The high number of classes and its unbalanced number of images for bird takes us to reduce the number of classes and takes classes with a sufficient and reasonable number of images for class.

The main goal of our project is to build a model that can classify images with high accuracy, allowing us to automate and streamline the process of categorizing images.
